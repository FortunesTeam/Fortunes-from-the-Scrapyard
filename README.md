**Fortunes from the Scrapyard** is a community led, cyberpunk-inspired, content mod for Risk of Rain 2. A group effort to add some new mechanics and extra love for the game! It features a handful of unique items, three new survivors, and a new interactable shrine. As the project grows we may add a Wiki, but for now... discover away! The project has a couple of planned expansions, from extra survivors to a new type of item rarity, so stayed tuned for more.

![New Items...](TheCommissionProject/Assets/ReadmeAssets/1.gif)

* **New Items & Equipment** - Survival is not guaranteed in the streets of Neptune's Reach, nor the wilderness of Petrichor V, take with you brand new items to ensure your safety. Bring extra food to heal, speed out of danger, or focus extra damage with *Takeout*, or tag your enemies away with *Shattered Spray Can*!

![New Survivors...](TheCommissionProject/Assets/ReadmeAssets/2.gif)

* **Cloaker** - A stealthy and fast-paced survivor with the ability to mark their enemies and dissapear into the shadows. Play back from range and shoot away, or sneak into the center of the stage for massive damage.

* **Trapper** - Master of crowd control, Trapper excels at keeping his enemies slowed down increasing damage against them the more they are locked in place. Fight alone, or beat the drums of rebellion as you support your allies.

* **Skater** - Fast, agile, and bubbly. Skater puts the combo mechanic into play with her quick shooting and quick gliding around the battlefield.

![New Interactables...](TheCommissionProject/Assets/ReadmeAssets/3.gif)

* **New Interactables** - The Shrine of Extraction: Spawn a **Scrap Elite** ready to fight you and your allies, don't let it hit you. Discover the secrets of the shrine... you've definitely seen a drop pod similar to this before, this may be your ticket home.
