# FixPluginTypesSerialization

Hook into the native Unity engine for adding BepInEx plugin assemblies into the assembly list that is normally used for the assemblies sitting in the game Managed/ folder.

This solve a bug where custom Serializable structs and such stored in plugin assemblies are not properly getting deserialized by the engine.

### Installation

- Copy the `BepInEx/patchers/FixPluginTypesSerialization` folder into your `BepInEx/patchers` folder.

- Copy the `BepInEx/config/FixPluginTypesSerialization.cfg` folder into your `BepInEx/config` folder.
